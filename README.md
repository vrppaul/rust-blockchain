> This project will stay in development stage forever.

## TODO

- [ ] Come up with a purpose of the blockchain
- [x] Blockchain/Block/Transaction structures
- [x] Transactions have weight, which decides the speed of transaction verification
- [x] Some mining algorithm
- [x] CLI application, which lets either create a transaction or mine a block
- [ ] Multiple nodes can interact with blockchain at least locally
- [ ] Some sort of data persistance at least locally
- [ ] Transaction signing
- [ ] Mining reward
- [ ] P2P communication
- [ ] All miners mine same block
- [ ] Add `rustyline` as a CLI editor: https://docs.rs/rustyline/8.2.0/rustyline/
